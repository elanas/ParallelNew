Part 1:

For part 1, I have split the main program is held in CoinFlip.java. There are three
bash scripts which represent the three different experiments that took place:
speedup, scaleup and startup costs.

The part1 directory contains a "make" file called make.sh. The make file is a bash script
that will compile the CoinFlip.java program. The make file
can be called with the following command:

./make.sh

In order to run an experiment, the particular bash file can be called with the 
following commands:

To collet data to measure speedup:
./speedup_bash.sh

To collet data to measure scaleup:
./scaleup_bash.sh

To collet data to measure startup costs:
./startup_bash.sh

*In order to record a meaningful
time sample for startup costs, it would be helpful to open the CoinFlip.java program and comment
out lines 69 and 93 (where time is recorded in milliseconds) and uncomment lines
70 and 94 (where time is recorded in nanoseconds).

The CoinFlip program can be run indepedently with the following code:

./make.sh
java CoinFlip #threads #flips

Each experiment writes to a csv file called "output.csv" which
holds the time-data recorded for the experiment. 


Part 2:

For part 2, the main program is called BruteForceDES.java. This 
program's usage is below:

Usage: BruteForceDES #threads key_size_in_bits

In order to compile the program, there is a 'make' file called
make.sh which can be called with the following command:

./make.sh

The program can be run with the following command:

java BruteForceDES #threads key_size_in_bits

One can also run the speedup or scaleup experiments by
calling either:

./speedup_bash.sh

or

./scaleup_bash.sh

depending on which experiment you would like to write. Both 
scripts save the time data to a csv called "output.csv".
